Software installation
=====================

First, you have to install Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) either on your system or in a virtual
machine.

Next, install our version of ROS packages from ``packages.bit-bots.de``. Just follow the
instructions on the website (if you never used ROS before, you do not have to execute the first two
commands). Then, install the required ROS packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install python3-pip ros-melodic-amcl ros-melodic-controller-interface ros-melodic-controller-manager ros-melodic-controller-manager-msgs ros-melodic-desktop-full ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control ros-melodic-hector-gazebo ros-melodic-hector-gazebo-plugins ros-melodic-imu-sensor-controller ros-melodic-joint-state-controller ros-melodic-joint-trajectory-controller ros-melodic-map-server ros-melodic-move-base ros-melodic-moveit ros-melodic-moveit-core ros-melodic-moveit-resources ros-melodic-moveit-ros-planning ros-melodic-moveit-ros-planning-interface ros-melodic-plotjuggler ros-melodic-pointcloud-to-laserscan ros-melodic-robot-controllers ros-melodic-robot-controllers-interface ros-melodic-robot-controllers-msgs ros-melodic-robot-localization ros-melodic-ros-control ros-melodic-ros-controllers ros-melodic-rqt-controller-manager ros-melodic-rqt-joint-trajectory-controller ros-melodic-yocs-velocity-smoother ros-melodic-spatio-temporal-voxel-layer ros-melodic-rviz-imu-plugin ros-melodic-imu-complementary-filter ros-melodic-joy


After that, create an account on https://github.com/ and get team access to our organization
(https://github.com/bit-bots). Then, in a terminal, execute ``ssh-keygen`` and then
``cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` and copy the text. Go back to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys. There,
click on New SSH Key and paste the result.

.. note::
    If you're not part of our team, you can skip this step and use https in the next stept to clone the git.

Now, in a terminal, execute ``git clone git@github.com:bit-bots/bitbots_meta.git`` to download our
software meta package. Confirm the host key by typing ``yes``. Then, go to the folder by executing
``cd bitbots_meta``. Use ``make pull-init`` to download all of the software.

.. note::
    The script may tell you to install basler drivers. You can ignore this if you dont want to
    use the actual robot hardware.

We need to install additional python packages, that are not available via apt.
To do this, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

Next, we need a catkin workspace. Execute ``mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src`` to create a workspace and go
there with ``cd ~/catkin_ws``.
Execute ``export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin`` to setup your path environment.
Use ``source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash`` to source your ROS environment.
Execute ``catkin init`` to initialize the workspace and ``catkin config -DPYTHON_VERSION=3`` to set the correct python version.
Now, execute ``ln -s ~/bitbots_meta src`` to link the source directory. Finally, build the
software with ``catkin build -c``.

To make the changes persistent, open your bashrc with ``nano ~/.bashrc`` and paste the following
three lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
    source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
    source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
